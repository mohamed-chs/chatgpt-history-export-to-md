## 📖 How to Use

### Step 1: Export Your ChatGPT Data

1. Sign in at [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com)
2. Navigate to: **Profile Name** (bottom left) → **Settings** → **Data controls** → **Export**
3. Click **Confirm export**
4. Wait for the email from OpenAI, then download the `.zip` file

<details>
<summary><strong>Alternative: Use the Direct Export Script</strong></summary>

If you want to grab recent conversations quickly or bypass the official export wait, use the direct export script.

1.  Follow the instructions in [`js/HOW_TO_USE.md`](https://github.com/mohamed-chs/convoviz/blob/main/js/HOW_TO_USE.md) to download your recent data as a `.zip` file.
2.  **Run Convoviz normally.**
3.  **Smart Discovery:** If you have a `convoviz_export.zip` in your `Downloads`, Convoviz will ask to merge it.
4.  **Additive & Smart:** You can combine multiple runs into the same folder. Convoviz uses identity-based overwriting to update existing chats without creating duplicates!

### Step 3: Run Convoviz

The simplest way is to run this in your terminal and follow the interactive prompts:

```

Or, provide arguments directly to skip the prompts:

```bash
convoviz --input path/to/your/export.zip --output path/to/output/folder
```

<details>
<summary><strong>⚙️ Command Line Options</strong></summary>

#### Selective Output

By default, all outputs (Markdown, graphs, word clouds) are generated. Use `--outputs` to pick specific ones:

```bash
convoviz --input export.zip --outputs markdown --outputs graphs
```

Available options: `markdown`, `graphs`, `wordclouds`

> In interactive mode, you'll be prompted to choose which outputs to generate.

#### Other Useful Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--zip` / `-z` | Alias for `--input` (for convenience) |
| `--timestamp` / `-t` | Prepend conversation timestamp to the filename (e.g., `2024-03-21_15-30-05 - Title.md`) |
| `--no-interactive` | Force non-interactive mode |
| `--flat` | Put all Markdown files in a single folder (instead of organizing by date) |
| `--config PATH` | Use a specific TOML config file (otherwise the user config is used if present) |
| `--verbose` / `-v` | Enable detailed logging (use `-vv` for debug logs) |
| `--log-file PATH` | Specify a custom log file location |
| `--quiet` / `-q` | Reduce console output (still logs to file) |

For a complete list of options:

```bash
convoviz --help
```

<details>
<summary><strong>⚙️ Configuration</strong></summary>

Convoviz supports a TOML config file. Defaults are bundled with the package and can be copied into your user config directory.

Generate a user config file:

```bash
convoviz config init
```

Default user config locations:
1. Linux: `~/.config/convoviz/config.toml`
2. macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/convoviz/config.toml`
3. Windows: `%APPDATA%\\convoviz\\config.toml`

Use a custom config path:

```bash
convoviz --config path/to/config.toml
```

Markdown flavor options in config:
1. `standard` (default)
2. `obsidian` (collapsible callouts for reasoning content)

Markdown render order (config):
1. `active` (default, current branch)
2. `full` (all DAG branches)

Markdown timestamps can be toggled with `conversation.markdown.show_timestamp`.

Word clouds can be limited to your messages by setting `wordcloud.include_assistant_text = false`.
Word cloud layouts are deterministic by default; set `wordcloud.random_state = ""` to disable.

YAML frontmatter titles are sanitized; the original title is preserved in `aliases` when it changes.

### Step 4: Check the Output 🎉

After running the script, head to your output folder (defaults to `Documents/ChatGPT-Data` if you didn't change it) to see:
- 📝 Neatly formatted Markdown files
- 📊 Visualizations and graphs
- 🎨 Extracted Canvas documents (if any)
- 🛡️ User "Custom Instructions" (`custom_instructions.json`)

If you've had a great experience, consider giving the project a ⭐ **star**! It keeps me motivated and helps others discover it!

## 📝 Notes

<details>
<summary><strong>Offline</strong></summary>

Word clouds use NLTK stopwords. If you're offline and NLTK data isn't installed yet, pre-download it:

```bash
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords')"
```

**NOTE:** The install script already handles this, so you can immediately go offline after running it.

<summary><strong>About This Project</strong></summary>

This is just a small thing I coded to help me see my convos in beautiful markdown. It was originally built with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (my go-to note-taking app) in mind, but the default output is standard Markdown.

I wasn't a fan of the clunky, and sometimes paid, browser extensions.

It was also a great opportunity to learn more about Python and type annotations. I had mypy, pyright, and ruff all on strict mode, 'twas fun.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Direct Export (Experimental)</strong></summary>

There's also a JavaScript export flow under `js/` for grabbing additional conversation data directly from the browser outside the official ZIP export. This is experimental.
