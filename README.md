### 2. Install the tool 🛠

Try it without installing using uv ([astral-sh/uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)):

```bash
uvx convoviz
```

You can install it with uv (Recommended):

You can provide arguments directly to skip the prompts:

```

Inputs can be any of:
- A ChatGPT export ZIP (downloaded from OpenAI)
- An extracted export directory containing `conversations.json`
- A `conversations.json` file directly

Notes:
- `--zip` / `-z` is kept as an alias for `--input` for convenience.
- You can force non-interactive mode with `--no-interactive`.

For more options, run:

```bash
convoviz --help
```

And that's it! After running the script, head over to the output folder to see your nice word clouds, graphs, and neatly formatted Markdown files. Enjoy !

## Notes

This is just a small thing I coded to help me see my convos in beautiful markdown, in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (my go-to note-taking app).

I wasn't a fan of the clunky, and sometimes paid, browser extensions.

It was also a great opportunity to learn more about Python and type annotations. I had mypy, pyright, and ruff all on strict mode, 'twas fun.

It should(?) also work as library, so you can import and use the models and functions. I need to add more documentation for that tho. Feel free to reach out if you need help.

### Offline / reproducible runs

Convoviz uses NLTK stopwords for word clouds. If you’re offline and NLTK data isn’t already installed, pre-download it once:

```bash
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords')"
```

If you’re using `uv` without a global install, you can run:

```bash
uv run python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords')"
```

### Bookmarklet

There’s also a JavaScript bookmarklet flow under `js/` (experimental) for exporting additional conversation data outside the official ZIP export.
