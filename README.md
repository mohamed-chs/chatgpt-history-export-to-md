## ChatGPT-Conversations to Markdown (MD) Converter 🚀
Welcome to the ChatGPT-Conversations to Markdown converter! This Python script helps you to convert conversations extracted from ChatGPT into a neatly formatted Markdown (MD) file. Follow the steps below to get started! 😄

#### Step 1: Setting Up 🛠
First things first, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

#### Step 2: Download the Script 📥
Download the entire script project from this GitHub page. You can do this by clicking the green 'Code' button near the top right corner and choosing the 'Download ZIP' option.

#### Step 3: Extract Files 📂
Once the ZIP file is downloaded, extract it to a convenient location on your computer.

#### Step 4: Install Dependencies 🛒
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you extracted the files. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
# Replace "path/to/directory" with the path to your script's directory
cd path/to/directory
```

#### Step 5: Organize Your Conversations 🗂
Before running the script, ensure that your ChatGPT conversations are in a ZIP file format. The script is set up to automatically look for the most recent ZIP file in your 'Downloads' folder. However, you can specify a different file or location if necessary.

#### Step 6: Running the Script 🏃‍♂️
In the terminal or command prompt, run the script using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

#### Optional: Customize Script Inputs 🌟
You can customize the script's behavior using additional parameters:

- `--out_folder`: Specify the output folder where the MD files will be saved.
- `--zip_file`: Specify the ZIP file containing the ChatGPT conversations to be converted.

For example:

```bash
python main.py --out_folder "C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\My Conversations" --zip_file "C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads\my_chat.zip"
```

#### Step 7: Check the Output 🎉
Once the script runs successfully, check the specified output folder (or the default location) for the generated Markdown files. Each conversation will have its own file with details neatly formatted.

#### Help and Support 🆘
If you face any issues or have suggestions to improve the script, feel free to raise an issue on this GitHub page.

#### Enjoy Your Conversations in Markdown! 🎈
We hope you find this tool useful for enjoying your ChatGPT conversations in a new, neat, and organized format!
